# CARE – A Social Media Platform for Care Seekers & Givers 💙

CARE is a social impact platform that connects **care seekers** (people who need short-term help caring for elderly family members) with **care givers** (teenagers/students looking for passive income through meaningful work).  
Originally inspired during the development of a general social platform called *ConnectSphere*, CARE was built to address a real-world challenge with compassion and code.
